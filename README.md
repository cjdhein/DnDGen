# DnDGen
Automated generators for use by DMs.
Currently this is just a simple settlement generator.

## Server and Site
The server simply hosts the raw data and provides a generator at an endpoint for the client to call on. The actual front-end site is in the 'site/' directory and can be run locally after downloading.
